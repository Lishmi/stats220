## Ads seen whilst on social media

This report is based on observational data collected from my own social media scroll sessions over several days. Each time I opened Instagram or TikTok, I logged key details about what I saw. I recorded whether the first post was an ad or regular content, how many ads appeared during the session, what the ads were about, which platform I was using, whether the ads felt relevant to me, and how long the scroll session lasted. The purpose of collecting this data was to explore patterns in online advertising â€” including how frequently ads appear, what types of ads are most common, and how personalised or targeted they seem. 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)


logged_data <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR6F7RwSGQIJ4_z8o1I_lDmgSY0OXXLRriy1z8NUka-mRN0jPE4P7aC3RGvcFru6V2sRU5dzZkuaV2E/pub?gid=1723247763&single=true&output=csv")

    platform_used = "What platform were you using when you saw the ad?",
