## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me: 

- I am undertaking a degree in **Statistics**
- I am taking STATS 220 because I really want to strengthen my data analysis skills, especially in *R programming*.
- I am interested in learning about how to apply and analyze data to make informed decisions and improve problem-solving skills using R programming.
