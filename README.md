# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because I really want to strengthen my data analysis skills, especially in R programming.
- I am interested in learning about how to apply and analyze data to make informed decisions and improve problem-solving skills using R programming.
